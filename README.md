This mod adds the Rabbit of Caerbannog from the movie titled ***Monty Python and Holy Grail***, published in 1974. That's the most foul, cruel, and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on!
	
# New Incidents:

- Rabbit of Caerbannog: Spawns a killer rabbit on the edge of the map. (base chance = 2.0 with 15 day cooldown)
- Rabbit of Caerbannog Pack: Spawns 2-6 killer rabbits on the edge of the map. (base chance = 2.0 with 30 day cooldown)

# Rabbit of Caerbannog:

- Fierce predator with combat stats comparable to that of a bear.
- Uses front paws for claw attacks in addition to bite attacks (unlike vanilla rabbit)
- Spawns neutral but has 100% chance to retaliate on attack.
- Spawns hungry, has fast hunger rate and will hunt for food immediately.
- 75% chance to attack on failed tame attempt.
- Intermediate Intelligence (release command training)
- Butchering yields Caerbannog Fur which is a small downgrade compared to the stats of thrumbofur.
- Only spawns through the Rabbit of Caerbannog incidents.
	
# Mod Interactions:

- [Wild Animal Sex](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1224175982): Rabbit packs will start having orgy when they first spawn and can potentially become an invasive species that takes over the entire map when left unchecked.

# Mod Support: (optional)

- Compatible with [A Dog Said](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=746425621) if using the mod [A Dog Said Easy Patcher](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=944381237) with the correct load order.
